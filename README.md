# Tree Punching Simulator
## Description
This is a package for Nano's World that demonstrates mass spawned props being used to gather "resources". Most of the process is done on the server end, then the data is sent to the client to display the information. When the resources dry up on a certain tree, the tree falls and despawns shortly after, then will respawn after some time.
 USE ON BLANKMAP!
